# .github - a hidden gem in repository management

All github meta files are stored here; all workflows
are automatically updated from here via a pull-request.

[You can read more about this feature and its supported functionality
here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file#supported-file-types).

## Why?

I learned about `.github` repository during my exploration of how the
[terraform-aws-modules organization](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules)
was setup on Public GitHub.
I have been thinking about ways to reduce copy-pasting between similar
repositories for several years.

## Shared Workflows

To minimize maintenance of governance and standards,
this repo's workflows are all shared workflows.
***We need more documentation on these***

This means that other repositories may use simplified calls to
the workflows in this repository, and if we enhance the governance
/ standards here the maintenance in other repo's will be minimal.

The following workflows should be included in every
Repository in this organization:

1. [![Issue & PR Maintenance](https://github.com/sassy-bulldog/.github/actions/workflows/stale.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sassy-bulldog/.github/actions/workflows/stale.yml)
    - This automates marking, locking, and eventually
    closing stale Issues and Pull-Requests every night for a repository
2. [![Repository Governance](https://github.com/sassy-bulldog/.github/actions/workflows/repo-gov.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sassy-bulldog/.github/actions/workflows/repo-gov.yml)
    - Ensures that Governance standards for the repository and
    branch-protection rules have been followed.
3. [!['Code-Owners are Team(s)'](https://github.com/sassy-bulldog/.github/actions/workflows/codeowners.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sassy-bulldog/.github/actions/workflows/codeowners.yml)
    - Requires that the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file contains
    references to organizational teams - **not individual users**
4. [!['Conventional Commits'](https://github.com/sassy-bulldog/.github/actions/workflows/conventional-commits.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sassy-bulldog/.github/actions/workflows/conventional-commits.yml)
    - Requires that all Pull requests follow
    [Conventional Commit Standards](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
5. [![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/sassy-bulldog/.github/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/sassy-bulldog/.github/main)
6. [![Release](https://github.com/sassy-bulldog/.github/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sassy-bulldog/.github/actions/workflows/release.yml)
    - If the all commits have followed
    [Conventional Commit Standards](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/),
    this automates updating the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.MD)
    and the creation of a GitHub release with release notes.
